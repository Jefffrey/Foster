### Installation

To install `foster` you need to install the Haskell Platform and then run:

```
cabal update
cabal install foster
```

### Global flags

You can test that everything works properly by running:

```
foster --version
```

which will print the version.

You can also call `--help` from `foster` or any of the subcommands to open a manual page that will describe the syntax for every command.

You can always turn off output, by appending the `-s`/`--silent` flag. This may or may not improve performance.

#### Generating puzzles

In order to generate puzzles you need to write:

```
foster generate <rows>,<columns>
```

By default the puzzle is written to `input.txt`, but you can change that with the `--output` or `-o` flag. You can also specify the string to be used for the puzzle (by default is some string containing unicode characters and digits) with `--text` or `-t`.

For example, to generate a 3000x123 (3000 rows, 123 columns) puzzle stored in `input2.txt` using the text `Some string` you can use:

```
foster generate 3000,123 --output=input2.txt --text="Some string"
```

or equivalently:

```
foster generate 1000,1000 -oinput2.txt -t"Some String"
```

#### Solving puzzles

To solve puzzle you'll need to specify the input file (the file containing the pieces) and the output file (the file where to put the generated puzzle):

```
foster solve --input=input2.txt --output=output2.txt
```

The above will take the puzzle in `input2.txt` and solve it into `output2.txt`. By default `foster` will take the puzzle in `input.txt` and store it into `output.txt`.

##### Checking solutions

If you have a solution generated by some other program, you can check it against the one `foster` would generate by using:

```
foster check --input=input2.txt --output=output2.txt
```

Which will check that the solution in `output2.txt` is valid, given the input puzzle `input2.txt`. By default it will use `input.txt` and `output.txt` respectively.
